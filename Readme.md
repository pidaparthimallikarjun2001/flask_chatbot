# WHAT IT DOES

This is a simple Flask chatbot, It greets you and then asks for your name. It will wish you back with your name. You can ask things like "who are you?", "what can you do?" etc,. It responds appropriately. You can even ask it to "tell me a quote" and it tells you a quote. You can thannk it as well by saying "thank you". For now, this bot has limited features. If you ask it other than what is mentioned above, it will respond with the default message "Sorry! For now, I am programmed to do limited things".

# HOW I DID IT AND WHAT I LEARNT
I really learnt a lot and enjoyed a lot while building this chatbot. I began to think in a broad way! I learnt how  to use Flask, python etc., I built this using DRY Principle i.e., DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF Principle. I reused the existing components and built this. This journey has been very fun and exciting!!! Moreover, I developed self-learning!
