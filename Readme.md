This is a simple Flask chatbot, It greets you and then asks for your name. It will wish you back with your name. You can ask things like "who are you?", "what can you do?" etc,. It responds appropriately. You can even ask it to "tell me a quote" and it tells you a quote. You can thannk it as well by saying "thank you". For now, this bot has limited features.
